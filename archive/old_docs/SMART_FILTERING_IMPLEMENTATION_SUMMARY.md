## üöÄ **Key Changes Implemented**

### **Stage 1: Smart Discovery Triage - COMPLETELY REWRITTEN**

**File:** `early_gem_detector.py` - Lines 6450-6598  
**Method:** `_quick_triage_candidates()` ‚Üí **Smart Discovery-Based Triage**

#### **New Intelligence Features:**

**1. Source-Specific Smart Scoring:**
```python
# Moralis Graduated (Rich Data Available)
if source == 'moralis_graduated':
    # Time-sensitive fresh graduate bonus
    if hours_since_grad <= 1:  priority_score += 40
    if hours_since_grad <= 6:  priority_score += 25
    # Market cap validation: $50K-$2M sweet spot
    # Liquidity validation: >$50K for good liquidity

# Moralis Bonding (Time-Critical)  
elif source == 'moralis_bonding':
    # Graduation proximity (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
    if bonding_progress >= 95:  priority_score += 50  # Imminent!
    if bonding_progress >= 90:  priority_score += 35  # Very close
    # Market cap validation: $5K-$500K for bonding tokens

# Birdeye Trending (Market Validated)
elif source == 'birdeye_trending':
    priority_score += 30  # Already trending bonus
```

**2. Time-Critical Opportunity Detection:**
- **<1h since graduation:** +40 points (ultra-fresh graduates)
- **>95% bonding progress:** +50 points (imminent graduation)  
- **Ultra-fresh launches:** +8 points (age <1h)

**3. Data Quality Validation:**
- **Valid Solana address:** +5 points
- **Reasonable symbol:** +3 points  
- **Age-based freshness:** +2 to +8 points

**4. Dynamic Source-Aware Thresholds:**
```python
if source == 'moralis_graduated':    threshold = 25  # Rich data
elif source == 'moralis_bonding':    threshold = 30  # Time-critical
elif source == 'birdeye_trending':   threshold = 30  # Pre-validated
else:                                threshold = 20  # Conservative
```

### **Stage 2: Enhanced Analysis - COMPLETELY FIXED**

**File:** `early_gem_detector.py` - Lines 6625-6687  
**Method:** `_enhanced_candidate_analysis()` ‚Üí **Actually Enhanced**

#### **Real Enhancement Features:**

**1. Progressive Scoring System:**
```python
# Start with Stage 1 discovery priority score
discovery_score = candidate.get('discovery_priority_score', 0)

# Add enrichment bonuses from batch data
enrichment_bonus = 0

# Volume validation: +5 to +15 points
# Trading activity: +5 to +10 points  
# Holder distribution: +5 to +10 points
# Security score: +4 to +8 points

enhanced_score = discovery_score + enrichment_bonus
```

**2. Data-Quality Aware Thresholds:**
```python
if source == 'moralis_bonding' and data_quality == 'high':
    threshold = 45  # High bar with good data
elif source == 'moralis_graduated' and data_quality == 'high': 
    threshold = 40  # Good bar with data
else:
    threshold = 35  # Conservative default
```

**3. Intelligent Error Handling:**
- Keeps high-priority candidates even if enrichment fails
- Uses discovery priority as fallback score

## üìä **Expected Filtering Performance**

| Stage | Before | After | Improvement |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Stage 1** | 40-80 ‚Üí 38-76 **(5% reduction)** | 40-80 ‚Üí 20-35 **(50-60% reduction)** | **10x better** |
| **Stage 2** | varies (broken) | 20-35 ‚Üí 15-25 **(25-30% reduction)** | **Actually functional** |
| **Stage 3** | All remaining ‚Üí final | 15-25 ‚Üí final | **Quality input** |

## üéØ **Smart Filtering Logic**

### **Time-Sensitive Prioritization:**

**Ultra-High Priority (50+ points):**
- Bonding tokens >95% complete (imminent graduation)
- Fresh graduates <1h since graduation

**High Priority (35-49 points):**
- Bonding tokens 85-94% complete  
- Fresh graduates <6h since graduation
- Trending tokens with validation

**Medium Priority (25-34 points):**
- Recent graduates <12h since graduation
- Mid-stage bonding tokens 75-84%
- SOL ecosystem tokens

### **Market Validation Logic:**

**For Graduated Tokens:**
- Sweet spot: $50K-$2M market cap (+20 points)
- Early stage: $10K-$50K (+15 points)
- Good liquidity: >$50K (+15 points)

**For Bonding Tokens:**
- Optimal range: $5K-$500K (+15 points)  
- Very early: <$5K but >$0 (+10 points)
- Graduation proximity: Most important factor

**For Trending Tokens:**
- Market pre-validation bonus (+30 points)
- Will be enriched in Stage 2 for full analysis
