## ⚠️ **Identified Gaps & Recommendations**

### Minor Implementation Gaps

#### 1. **PumpPortal Trading Execution (MINOR GAP)**
```
Guide Requirement:
POST https://pumpportal.fun/api/trade?api-key=YOUR_KEY
- Direct buy/sell execution on bonding curve

Current Status:
✅ Comprehensive monitoring and analysis
❌ Direct trading execution endpoint missing

Recommendation:
- Add PumpPortal trading API integration
- Implement buy/sell execution with slippage controls
- Add risk management for automated trading
```

#### 2. **Exact VLR Threshold Alignment (CONFIGURATION)**
```
Guide Specification: VLR >1.5-3.0 threshold
Current Implementation: Adaptive dynamic thresholds

Gap Analysis:
- System uses intelligent adaptive thresholds
- Could add guide-specific threshold option
- Current approach is more sophisticated but less standardized

Recommendation:
- Add configuration option for guide-specific thresholds
- Maintain adaptive system as primary approach
- Add comparison mode for guide compliance testing
```

#### 3. **Time Window Optimization (MINOR)**
```
Guide Focus: 5-30 minutes post-launch optimal window
Current Implementation: Multi-timeframe analysis

Gap Analysis:
- System covers broader time ranges (0-48 hours)
- May need fine-tuning for 5-30 minute sweet spot
- Current approach provides more comprehensive coverage

Recommendation:
- Add specific 5-30 minute window filtering
- Create guide-compliant detection mode
- Maintain comprehensive coverage as default
```

### Enhanced Features Beyond Guide
