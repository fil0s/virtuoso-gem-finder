# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the Early Token Monitor project structure to follow Python best practices and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 🗂️ Directory Structure Changes

1. **Moved Tests to Root Level**
   - `early_token_monitor/tests/` → `tests/`
   - Removed nested `early_token_monitor/` directory
   - Created proper test subdirectories: `unit/`, `integration/`, `fixtures/`

2. **Organized Scripts Directory**
   - Created subdirectories: `debug/`, `tests/`, `results/`
   - Moved test scripts to `scripts/tests/`
   - Moved debug scripts to `scripts/debug/`
   - Moved result files to `scripts/results/`

3. **Cleaned Up Root Directory**
   - Moved `virtuoso_gem_finder.log` to `logs/`
   - Moved `env.template` to `config/`
   - Removed clutter from root directory

4. **Enhanced Configuration Organization**
   - Centralized configuration files in `config/` directory
   - Maintained proper separation of environment templates

```

### ✅ Verification

- [x] Main application (`monitor.py`) imports successfully
- [x] No broken import paths
- [x] All files properly categorized
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Clean root directory structure

### 📚 Documentation Added

- Created `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` with comprehensive structure documentation
- Documented directory purposes and organization principles
- Added migration notes and best practices

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with logical directory structure
2. **Better Testing Organization**: Proper test hierarchy with unit, integration, and mock data separation
3. **Enhanced Development Workflow**: Scripts organized by purpose for easier navigation
4. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Essential files only in root, supporting files in appropriate subdirectories
5. **Standard Python Structure**: Follows Python project best practices for better collaboration

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding any missing test files to the appropriate test subdirectories
2. Update any documentation that references old file paths
3. Add `.gitkeep` files to empty directories if needed for version control
4. Consider adding a `src/` directory if the project grows larger

## Impact

- ✅ Zero breaking changes to functionality
- ✅ Improved project organization
- ✅ Better adherence to Python standards
- ✅ Enhanced developer experience
- ✅ Easier maintenance and navigation
