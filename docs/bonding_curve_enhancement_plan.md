# ðŸ”¥ PUMP.FUN BONDING CURVE ENHANCEMENT PLAN

## Phase 1: Bonding Curve Velocity Tracking (IMMEDIATE)
- Track market cap progression from $0 to $69K
- Calculate velocity ($/hour growth rate)
- Predict graduation timing based on trajectory
- Generate early warning alerts at $55K (80% to graduation)

## Phase 2: Optimal Position Sizing (24 HOURS)
- Discovery Scout: Focus on $0-5K launches (maximum upside)
- Conviction Core: Target $5K-35K momentum tokens
- Moonshot Hunter: Position in $35K-65K pre-graduation surge

## Phase 3: Advanced Graduation Monitoring (48 HOURS)
- Real-time velocity analysis
- Graduation prediction algorithms
- Staged exit signals (50% at $55K, 80% at $65K, 100% at $69K)
- Supply burn advantage analysis

## Expected ROI Enhancement
- Current Stage 2 strategy: 2-10x returns in 6-72 hours
- Enhanced bonding curve strategy: 5-50x returns in 0-72 hours
- Graduation timing optimization: +20% profit capture
- Position sizing optimization: +30% capital efficiency

## Technical Implementation
1. Enhance pump_fun_integration.py with bonding curve tracking
2. Add velocity calculation methods
3. Implement graduation prediction algorithms
4. Update wallet coordination for optimal positioning

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Entry timing improvement: Target 0-6 hour detection
- Exit timing optimization: 95% graduation prediction accuracy
- Profit enhancement: 2-3x improvement over current returns
- Risk reduction: Early warning system for graduation exits
