## 🔧 Configuration Status

### **Production Configuration Active:**
```yaml
# config/api_endpoints.yaml
environments:
  production:
    dexscreener:
      base_url: "https://api.dexscreener.com"
      timeout: 12
      endpoints:
        search: "/latest/dex/search"
        tokens: "/latest/dex/tokens"
    
    pump_fun:
      base_url: "https://frontend-api.pump.fun"
