# Enhanced Age Scoring Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for enhanced age scoring in the token discovery system. The enhancement will provide maximum advantage for ultra-fresh token discoveries while maintaining system integrity and reliability.

## Current System Analysis

### Current Age Scoring Issues
- **Uniform Scoring**: All tokens under 24h get same score (100/20 points)
- **No Fresh Token Advantage**: No distinction between 1-hour vs 23-hour old tokens
- **Linear Decay**: Doesn't match exponential gem potential curve
- **Missing Multipliers**: No total score bonuses for ultra-new discoveries

### Current Implementation Locations
1. **Quick Scoring**: `services/early_token_detection.py` lines 930-938
2. **Comprehensive Scoring**: `services/early_token_detection.py` lines 1642-1650
3. **Weight Configuration**: `config/config.yaml` lines 147-154

## Enhanced Design Specification

### 8-Tier Age Scoring System
| Age Range | Points | Bonus Multiplier | Description |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| ≤30 min | 120 | 1.20 (+20%) | Ultra-new |
| 30min-2h | 110 | 1.10 (+10%) | Extremely new |
| 2-6h | 100 | 1.0 | Very new |
| 6-24h | 85 | 1.0 | New |
| 1-3 days | 65 | 1.0 | Recent |
| 3-7 days | 45 | 1.0 | Moderate |
| 7-30 days | 25 | 1.0 | Established |
| >30 days | 10 | 1.0 | Mature |

### Weight Redistribution
- **Age**: 20% → 25% (+5%)
- **Liquidity**: 30% → 28% (-2%)
- **Price Change**: 20% → 18% (-2%)
- **Volume**: 15% → 14% (-1%)
- **Concentration**: 10% → 10% (unchanged)
- **Trend Dynamics**: 5% → 5% (unchanged)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation & Backup
1. **Create Backups**
   ```bash
   cp config/config.yaml config/config.yaml.backup_before_age_enhancement
   cp services/early_token_detection.py services/early_token_detection.py.backup_before_age_enhancement
   ```

2. **Validate Current System**
   - Run baseline tests
   - Document current score distributions
   - Record current alert rates

### Phase 2: Configuration Updates
1. **Update Scoring Weights** (`config/config.yaml`)
   ```yaml
   scoring_weights:
     liquidity: 0.28    # Reduced from 0.30
     age: 0.25          # Increased from 0.20
     price_change: 0.18 # Reduced from 0.20
     volume: 0.14       # Reduced from 0.15
     concentration: 0.10
     trend_dynamics: 0.05
   ```

2. **Validate Weight Distribution**
   - Ensure weights sum to 1.0
   - Test configuration loading

### Phase 3: Core Implementation
1. **Add Enhanced Age Scoring Function**
   ```python
   def _calculate_enhanced_age_score_and_bonus(self, creation_time: float, current_time: float) -> Tuple[float, float]:
       """Calculate enhanced age score and bonus multiplier."""
       if not creation_time:
           return 12.5, 1.0  # Default for unknown age
       
       age_seconds = current_time - creation_time
       age_minutes = age_seconds / 60
       age_hours = age_seconds / 3600
       age_days = age_seconds / 86400
       
       # 8-tier scoring with bonus multipliers
       if age_minutes <= 30:      # Ultra-new
           return 120, 1.20
       elif age_hours <= 2:       # Extremely new
           return 110, 1.10
       elif age_hours <= 6:       # Very new
           return 100, 1.0
       elif age_hours <= 24:      # New
           return 85, 1.0
       elif age_days <= 3:        # Recent
           return 65, 1.0
       elif age_days <= 7:        # Moderate
           return 45, 1.0
       elif age_days <= 30:       # Established
           return 25, 1.0
       else:                      # Mature
           return 10, 1.0
   ```

2. **Update Quick Scoring Method**
   - Replace current age scoring logic
   - Apply bonus multiplier to final score
   - Add detailed logging

3. **Update Comprehensive Scoring Method**
   - Replace current age scoring logic
   - Apply bonus multiplier to final score
   - Add detailed logging

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

#### Unit Tests
- Test age calculation with various timestamps
- Test bonus multiplier application
- Test edge cases (negative age, missing timestamps)
- Test weight distribution validation

#### Integration Tests
- Test with real token data from recent sessions
- Compare old vs new scoring for same tokens
- Verify score distribution changes
- Test alert generation with new thresholds

#### Validation Tests
- Run against known ultra-new tokens
- Verify bonus application
- Check mature tokens aren't unfairly penalized
- Validate system works without creation time
