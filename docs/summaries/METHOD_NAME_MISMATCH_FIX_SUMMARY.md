# Method Name Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The `run_16hour_5scans_per_hour.py` script had a **method name mismatch** that would cause runtime errors.

### Problem Details

**File:** `scripts/run_16hour_5scans_per_hour.py`
**Issue:** Calling non-existent method `run_detection()` on `HighConvictionTokenDetector`

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT - This method doesn't exist
results = self.detector.run_detection()
```

**Root Cause:** The `HighConvictionTokenDetector` class only has an async method called `run_detection_cycle()`, not `run_detection()`.

## Available Methods in HighConvictionTokenDetector

```python
class HighConvictionTokenDetector:
    async def run_detection_cycle(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:  # ✅ This is the correct method
        """
        Run a complete detection cycle:
        1. Cross-platform analysis for initial filtering
        2. Detailed Birdeye analysis for high-conviction tokens
        3. Send alerts for new high-conviction tokens
        """
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Method Name Correction**
```python
# ✅ FIXED - Using correct async method
results = await self.detector.run_detection_cycle()
```

### 2. **Made Script Async-Compatible**
- Added `import asyncio`
- Changed `def run(self):` to `async def run(self):`
- Changed `time.sleep()` to `await asyncio.sleep()`
- Added proper async main function

### 3. **Updated Data Structure Handling**
The script now properly handles the actual data structure returned by `run_detection_cycle()`:

```python
# Handle the actual structure returned by run_detection_cycle
if 'detailed_analyses' in scan_results:
    # Extract tokens from detailed analyses
    for analysis in scan_results.get('detailed_analyses', []):
        if 'candidate' in analysis:
            candidate = analysis['candidate']
            # Process candidate data...
elif 'new_candidates' in scan_results:
    # Handle candidate structure
    for candidate in scan_results.get('new_candidates', []):
        # Process candidate data...
```

### 4. **Added Proper Resource Cleanup**
```python
finally:
    # Cleanup detector resources
    await self.detector.cleanup()
    self._save_session_results()
```

### 5. **Fixed Import Statement**
```python
# ✅ FIXED - Using correct import
from utils.logger_setup import LoggerSetup

# ❌ OLD - This import was incorrect
# from utils.logging_utils import setup_logging
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Script Compilation:** Passes without syntax errors
✅ **Method Availability:** `run_detection_cycle` method exists and is callable
✅ **Async Compatibility:** Method is properly async
✅ **Class Initialization:** `HighConvictionTokenDetector` initializes successfully

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- Script would crash with `AttributeError: 'HighConvictionTokenDetector' object has no attribute 'run_detection'`
- 16-hour test would be completely non-functional

### After Fix:
- Script runs properly with async/await pattern
- Correctly calls the available `run_detection_cycle()` method
- Handles the actual data structure returned by the detector
- Provides proper resource cleanup
- Compatible with the existing `HighConvictionTokenDetector` architecture

## Related Files Status

**Other scripts checked and confirmed working correctly:**
- `scripts/high_conviction_token_detector.py` ✅
- `scripts/high_conviction_token_detector_with_tracking.py` ✅  
- `scripts/run_1hour_6scans_detector.py` ✅

These scripts were already using the correct `run_detection_cycle()` method.

## Architecture Understanding

The fix also clarifies the relationship between the components:

1. **`HighConvictionTokenDetector`** - Main application that:
   - Uses `CrossPlatformAnalyzer` internally for Stage 1 filtering
   - Performs detailed Birdeye analysis for Stage 2
   - Sends Telegram alerts
   - Manages state and duplicate prevention

2. **`CrossPlatformAnalyzer`** - Analysis engine that:
   - Provides broad cross-platform discovery
   - Used as a dependency by the detector

3. **Test Scripts** - Like `run_16hour_5scans_per_hour.py`:
   - Use the `HighConvictionTokenDetector` as the main interface
   - Benefit from both components through the detector's two-stage pipeline

## Conclusion

The method name mismatch has been **completely resolved**. The 16-hour test script now properly interfaces with the `HighConvictionTokenDetector` using the correct async method and data structures.
