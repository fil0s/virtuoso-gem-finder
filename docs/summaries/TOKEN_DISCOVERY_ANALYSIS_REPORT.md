## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® Strategy Performance Problems

#### 1. Strategy Discovery Failure
- **5 out of 6 strategies found 0 tokens**
- **Filters appear overly restrictive**
- **Missing opportunities** in different market segments

- **Missing cost optimization** opportunities
- **Inconsistent endpoint usage**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Token-Specific Concerns

#### 1. KBBB Paradox
- **Highest security score** (125,419) but worst performance (-18.84%)
- **Security doesn't guarantee** price stability
- **Risk assessment may need** performance weighting

#### 2. TRUMP Classification
- **Largest market cap** but marked "not promising"
- **Massive community** (641K holders) but declining
- **Algorithm correctly identified** overvaluation risk

## Conclusion

The token discovery analysis reveals a system with excellent security filtering and quality token identification capabilities, but significant optimization opportunities exist. The High Trading Activity Strategy successfully identified 10 high-quality tokens with strong security profiles and community adoption, while other strategies require parameter adjustment to become effective.

Key strengths include superior security filtering (90% safe tokens), excellent community adoption metrics (100% >10K holders), and successful API optimization. Critical areas for improvement include strategy parameter tuning, quality scoring algorithm review, and cache system optimization.

The discovered tokens present a diverse investment opportunity set ranging from high-momentum growth plays (SPX) to stable large-cap options (JLP), with strong overall security characteristics that align with conservative risk management principles.
