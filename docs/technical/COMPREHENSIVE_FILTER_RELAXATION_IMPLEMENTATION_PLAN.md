### 🔬 WEEK 1 ACTIONS (Ultra-Relaxed Testing Results)

2. **Ultra-Relaxed Configuration Testing Results**

   **Recent Listings Strategy**: ⚠️ **STILL NEEDS WORK**
   - Issue: Configuration parameter mismatch detected
   - Status: 0 tokens found despite ultra-relaxed config
   - Next step: Fix parameter mapping and re-test

   **Price Momentum Strategy**: ⚠️ **AGGRESSIVE FILTERING ISSUE**
   - Issue: Found 43 tokens but filtered out ALL due to excessive price changes
   - Problem: Ultra-strict momentum filtering (>100% price increase rejection)
   - Solution: Need to adjust momentum thresholds for high-volatility tokens
   
   **Liquidity Growth Strategy**: ❌ **API PARAMETER ERROR**
   - Issue: `get_token_list() got an unexpected keyword argument 'min_market_cap'`
   - Status: Configuration error preventing execution
   - Next step: Fix API parameter mapping
   
   **Smart Money Whale Strategy**: ⚠️ **THRESHOLD TOO HIGH**
   - Issue: Found 3 tokens but whale/smart money thresholds still too restrictive
   - Status: 0 tokens passed whale activity analysis
   - Next step: Further relax whale detection thresholds

## Week 1 Implementation Plan

### Priority 1: Fix Broken Strategies (Days 1-2)

#### A. Recent Listings Strategy Fix
```yaml
Issues to Address:
- Parameter mapping errors
- Age limit configuration
- API endpoint compatibility

Action Items:
1. Review and fix API parameter names
2. Implement proper age filtering
3. Test with corrected configuration
4. Target: Get first tokens discovered
```

#### B. Liquidity Growth Strategy Fix  
```yaml
Critical Issue: API parameter error
- Remove unsupported 'min_market_cap' parameter
- Use only supported BirdEye API parameters
- Implement market cap filtering in post-processing

Action Items:
1. Fix API parameter mapping
2. Move market cap filtering to processing stage
3. Re-test with corrected parameters
4. Target: Get strategy executing successfully
```

#### C. Price Momentum Strategy Optimization
```yaml
Core Issue: Over-aggressive momentum filtering
Current: Rejects ANY token with >100% 24h price increase
Problem: In crypto, 100%+ gains are normal for emerging tokens

Solution - Graduated Momentum Thresholds:
- Small tokens (<$100K mcap): Allow up to 2000% gains
- Medium tokens ($100K-$1M): Allow up to 1000% gains  
- Large tokens (>$1M): Allow up to 500% gains
- Implement volume-to-price-change correlation checks
```

#### D. Smart Money Whale Strategy Enhancement
```yaml
Current Thresholds Too High:
- min_whale_threshold: 5000 → 1000 (80% reduction)
- min_smart_money_score: 0.1 → 0.05 (50% reduction)
- min_trader_count: 3 → 1 (67% reduction)

Additional Enhancements:
- Implement whale activity confidence scoring
- Add small whale detection (1K-10K transactions)
- Include social sentiment from whale movements
```

### Priority 2: Quality vs Quantity Monitoring (Days 3-7)

#### A. Implement Quality Metrics Dashboard
```yaml
Key Metrics to Track:
1. Token Discovery Rate (tokens/hour)
2. Quality Score Distribution
3. Security Analysis Results
4. False Positive Rate
5. Token Performance Tracking (7-day, 30-day)

Implementation:
- Real-time quality monitoring
- Automated quality alerts
- Performance correlation analysis
- Strategy effectiveness tracking
```

#### B. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment System
```yaml
Adaptive Configuration:
- Monitor quality vs quantity trade-offs
- Automatically adjust thresholds based on market conditions
- Implement feedback loops from token performance
- Create strategy performance ranking system

Components:
1. Quality Score Tracking
2. Market Volatility Adjustment
3. Performance-Based Tuning
4. Alert System for Quality Degradation
```

### Priority 3: Advanced Optimization (Ongoing)

#### A. Market Condition Adaptive Filtering
```yaml
Bull Market Configuration:
- Relax price change thresholds (higher volatility expected)
- Increase volume requirements (more activity)
- Stricter holder concentration (avoid pump schemes)

Bear Market Configuration:  
- Tighten price change requirements (stability focus)
- Lower volume requirements (less overall activity)
- Relax holder requirements (fewer participants)

Sideways Market Configuration:
- Balanced approach between bull/bear settings
- Focus on fundamental metrics
- Emphasize smart money activity
```

#### B. Machine Learning Enhancement
```yaml
Predictive Quality Scoring:
- Train models on historical token performance
- Implement pattern recognition for successful tokens
- Create ensemble scoring combining multiple strategies
- Add sentiment analysis integration

Technical Implementation:
- Feature engineering from token metrics
- Time series analysis for momentum prediction
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Performance feedback integration
```
