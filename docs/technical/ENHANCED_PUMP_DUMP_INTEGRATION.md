### Final Score Comparison
```
📊 PHASE SCORING BREAKDOWN:
   Early Pump:       100.0  🟢 (Maximum boost)
   Momentum Pump:     95.0  🟡 (Moderate boost)
   Normal Token:      75.0  ⚪ (Baseline)

```

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1. Phase-Based Scoring Adjustments

**EARLY_PUMP Phase** (+25 to +50 points):
- Base bonus: +25 points
- Confidence bonus: +0 to +10 points
- Profit potential bonus: +0 to +15 points
- **Result**: Tokens with high profit potential get prioritized

**MOMENTUM_PUMP Phase** (+15 to +20 points):
- Base bonus: +15 points  
- Confidence bonus: +0 to +5 points
- **Result**: Moderate boost with risk awareness

**EXTREME_PUMP Phase** (-30 to -40 points):
- Significant penalty but not complete rejection
- Provides high-risk scalping opportunities for experienced traders
- Very aggressive risk management: 10 min max hold, 15% stop loss, 20% take profit
- **Result**: High-risk opportunities with tight controls

**DUMP Phases** (Score = 0):
- DUMP_START, DUMP_CONTINUATION, CRASH all rejected
- **Result**: Complete avoidance of dump scenarios

### 2. Enhanced Volume Analysis

```python
# Volume sustainability based on trading phase
if current_phase in ['EARLY_PUMP', 'MOMENTUM_PUMP']:
    # For pump phases, moderate volume is actually good
    if 5 <= volume_mcap_ratio <= 25:  # Sweet spot
        volume_score *= 1.1  # 10% bonus for sustainable volume
    elif volume_mcap_ratio > 50:  # Excessive even for pumps
        volume_score *= 0.4
else:
    # For normal phases, penalize excessive volume
    if volume_mcap_ratio > 20:
        volume_score *= 0.3
```

### 3. Smart Volatility Assessment

- **Removed** old blanket volatility penalties
- **Added** intelligent phase-based risk assessment
- **Result**: High volatility during pumps is expected and scored appropriately

## 📈 Trading Strategy Integration

### Score Interpretation for Trading

| Score Range | Phase | Action | Expected Outcome |
|------------|-------|--------|------------------|
| 95-100 | Early/Momentum Pump | **ENTER** | 150-200% profit target |
| 85-95 | High Opportunity | **MONITOR** | Strong potential |
| 75-85 | Good Baseline | **CONSIDER** | Standard opportunity |
| 50-75 | Medium Risk | **CAUTION** | Reduced position size |
| 20-50 | High Risk/Extreme Pump | **SCALP ONLY** | Very high risk, quick in/out |
| 0-20 | Critical Risk/Rejected | **AVOID** | Dump risk or poor fundamentals |

### Real-World Example: TDCCP Case

**Before Enhancement** (Would have scored ~70):
- High liquidity ✓
- New token ✓  
- Massive volume ✓
- **Problem**: Didn't detect pump phase

**After Enhancement** (Would score ~25):
- Detected as EXTREME_PUMP phase
- 75,000% gain triggers high-risk scalping opportunity
- **Result**: Very low score with aggressive risk management for experienced traders only

## 🛡️ Risk Management Features

### 1. Multi-Layered Protection
- **Phase Detection**: Identifies pump/dump stages
- **Volume Analysis**: Detects manipulation patterns  
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weights recommendations by certainty
- **Risk Classification**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW levels

### 2. Conservative Fallbacks
- Analysis errors default to penalties
- Missing data triggers medium risk classification
- Unknown phases get neutral treatment

### 3. Transparent Logging

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Entry Opportunity Detection
```python
# Token in early pump phase with sustainable volume
{
    'current_phase': 'EARLY_PUMP',
    'trading_opportunities': [{
        'action': 'ENTER',
        'estimated_profit_potential': 200.0,
        'max_hold_time_minutes': 120,
        'stop_loss_percentage': -25.0,
        'take_profit_percentage': 150.0
    }],
    'token_score': 100.0  # Maximum score due to opportunity
}
```

### Exit Signal Detection
```python
# Token in extreme pump phase (exit immediately)
{
    'current_phase': 'EXTREME_PUMP', 
    'trading_opportunities': [{
        'action': 'EXIT',
        'estimated_profit_potential': -50.0,  # Expected loss if staying
        'max_hold_time_minutes': 10,
        'reasoning': 'Extreme pump detected - imminent dump risk'
    }],
    'token_score': 0  # Rejected completely
}
```

### Extreme Pump Scalping
```python
# Token in extreme pump phase with scalping opportunity
{
    'current_phase': 'EXTREME_PUMP',
    'trading_opportunities': [
        {
            'action': 'ENTER_HIGH_RISK',
            'estimated_profit_potential': 25.0,  # Conservative target
            'max_hold_time_minutes': 10,  # Very short hold
            'stop_loss_percentage': -15.0,  # Tight stop loss
            'take_profit_percentage': 20.0,  # Quick take profit
            'risk_level': 'EXTREME'
        },
        {
            'action': 'EXIT',  # Also provides exit signal
            'max_hold_time_minutes': 5
        }
    ],
    'token_score': 24.5  # Low score but tradeable for experienced traders
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All detection thresholds are configurable in `config/config.example.yaml`:

```yaml
ANALYSIS:
  pump_dump_detection:
    enabled: true
    critical_price_spike_1h: 500.0    # >500% = CRITICAL
    high_price_spike_1h: 200.0        # >200% = HIGH RISK  
    medium_price_spike_1h: 100.0      # >100% = MEDIUM RISK
    # ... additional thresholds
```

## 📊 Performance Impact
