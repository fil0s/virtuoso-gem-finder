# Token Age-Aware Timeframe Selection: Implementation Summary

## Overview

The token-age aware timeframe selection feature has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Early Token Monitor system. This enhancement addresses the critical issue of missing OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for newer tokens, which previously prevented effective trend analysis.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **BirdeyeAPI Enhancements**:
   - Added `get_token_age` method to determine token age in days
   - Enhanced `get_ohlcv_data` method with age-appropriate timeframe selection
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing creation data
   - Added caching for token age data to reduce API calls

2. **TrendConfirmationAnalyzer Enhancements**:
   - Modified to accept token age information
   - Implemented age-based timeframe selection logic
   - Configured different lookback periods based on timeframe and age
   - Added age-specific scoring weights and thresholds

3. **Age Categories**:
   - New: <24 hours old (timeframes: 1m, 5m, 15m)
   - Recent: 1-3 days old (timeframes: 5m, 15m, 1h)
   - Developing: 3-7 days old (timeframes: 15m, 1h, 4h)
   - Established: >7 days old (timeframes: 1h, 4h, 1d)

4. **Development Mode Support**:
   - Added DEV_MODE flag to apply more lenient criteria
   - Created run_monitor_dev_mode.sh script
   - Implemented test_token_age_detection.py script

## Test Results

- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Token age detection works correctly
  - Fallback mechanisms operate as expected
  - Appropriate timeframes are selected based on age

- **Integration Testing**: 
  - System can handle tokens of all age categories
  - OHLCV data is fetched using appropriate timeframes
  - Age-specific scoring parameters are applied correctly

- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - Full system runs correctly with token-age awareness
  - Development mode operates with relaxed criteria
  - No regressions in existing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Increased Coverage**: The system can now effectively analyze tokens of all ages, including very new tokens.

2. **Age-Appropriate Analysis**: Different timeframes and parameters are used based on token age, improving analysis quality.

3. **Fairer Token Comparison**: Tokens are now evaluated against appropriate benchmarks for their age category.

4. **Improved Detection**: The system is better at detecting promising tokens early in their lifecycle.

5. **Robust Fallbacks**: Multiple methods to determine token age ensure the system works even with limited data.

## Next Steps

1. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust age-specific parameters based on real-world results.

2. **Stronger Caching**: Implement more robust caching for token creation timestamps.

3. **Advanced Fallbacks**: Enhance the fallback strategy for tokens with missing creation data.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize API usage for token age detection.

5. **Extended Analytics**: Add age-specific analytics to better understand token performance patterns.

## Enhanced Timeframe Selection

The token-age aware timeframe selection feature has been further enhanced with:

1. **Expanded Timeframe Options**: Now supporting all timeframes available in the Birdeye API:
   - Ultra-short timeframes: `1s`, `15s`, `30s`
   - Short timeframes: `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`
   - Medium timeframes: `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `6h`, `8h`, `12h`
   - Long timeframes: `1d`, `3d`, `1w`

2. **More Granular Age Categories**:
   - `new`: < 6 hours old
   - `very_recent`: 6-24 hours old
   - `recent`: 1-3 days old
   - `developing`: 3-7 days old
   - `established`: 7-30 days old
   - `mature`: > 30 days old

3. **Dynamic Lookback Periods**:
   - Each timeframe has an appropriate lookback period based on its granularity
   - Shorter timeframes use smaller lookback periods to reduce API data volume
   - Longer timeframes use extended lookback periods for better trend analysis

4. **Age-Specific Timeframe Weights**:
   - Each age category has optimized weightings for different timeframes
   - Newer tokens emphasize shorter timeframes (1s, 15s, 1m)
   - Mature tokens prioritize longer timeframes (1h, 4h, 1d)
   - This ensures the most relevant data points influence the trend score

5. **Tailored Scoring Thresholds**:
   - Adjusted trend confirmation thresholds based on token age
   - More lenient criteria for newer tokens with limited data
   - Stricter requirements for mature tokens with extensive history
   - Age-appropriate EMA and structure requirements

These enhancements allow for much more precise analysis of tokens at all stages of their lifecycle, from tokens that are just hours old to those that have been trading for months or years.

## Conclusion

The token-age aware timeframe selection feature has been successfully implemented and tested. This enhancement significantly improves the system's ability to analyze tokens of all ages, particularly newer tokens that previously could not be effectively evaluated due to missing historical data.
